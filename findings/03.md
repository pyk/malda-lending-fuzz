# Missing Arbitrum Support in ZK Coprocessor

## Summary

The contest README state that the Malda Lending protocol will be deployed on the
following chains:

> Ethereum, Base, Linea, Optimism, Unichain, Arbitrum.

However, the current implementation of the ZK Coprocessor lacks the necessary
validation logic to support the Arbitrum chain, only providing support for
Ethereum, Linea, and OP Stack-based chains. This creates a critical
functionality gap between the documented scope and the actual implementation.

## Root Cause

Arbitrum, while an Optimistic Rollup, uses a fundamentally different
architecture for its state commitments and fraud proofs compared to the OP
Stack, to which the current ZK Coprocessor is tightly coupled.

The complete absence of any code related to
[Arbitrum's L1 contracts](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-07-malda/blob/main/malda-zk-coprocessor/malda_utils/src/constants.rs)
or data structures confirms that it is not supported by the current ZK
Coprocessor.

## Internal Pre-conditions

No internal pre-conditions are required.

## External Pre-conditions

No external pre-conditions are required.

## Attack Path

This is not an attack.

## Impact

If an `mTokenGateway` contract were deployed on the Arbitrum chain as planned,
the protocol would be non-functional for that chain. Any cross-chain transaction
originating from Arbitrum (e.g `supplyOnHost`) would fail because the off-chain
Sequencer and ZK Coprocessor would be unable to generate the required ZK proofs
of state.

This would lead to a complete denial of service for users on Arbitrum.
Furthermore, any funds supplied to the `mTokenGateway` contract on Arbitrum
could become **permanently locked**, as there would be no valid mechanism to
prove their deposit on the host chain and mint the corresponding mTokens.
